1.Dot Product:

Definition: The dot product, also known as the scalar product or inner product, 
is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number.

Use Cases in Graphics:
Projection: Dot product is used to find the projection of one vector onto another.
            In computer graphics, this is often used in lighting calculations.
Angle Between Vectors: The dot product of normalized vectors gives the cosine of the angle between them.
                       This is used in determining the orientation of objects and in animations.

2.Cross Product:

Definition: The cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space,
            and it results in a vector perpendicular to both input vectors.


Use Cases in Graphics:
Surface Normal: Cross product is frequently used to calculate the normal vector to a surface. 
               This is crucial in lighting and shading calculations in computer graphics.
Rotation: Cross product is used in rotation operations,
           helping determine the axis of rotation and generating rotation matrices.
